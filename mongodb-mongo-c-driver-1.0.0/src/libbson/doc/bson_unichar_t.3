.fi

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.BR bson_unichar_t
provides an abstraction on a single unicode character. It is the 32-bit representation of a character. As UTF-8 can contain multi-byte characters, this should be used when iterating through UTF-8 text.

.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf
.nf
static void
print_each_char (const char *str)
{
   bson_unichar_t c;

   for (; *str; str = bson_utf8_next_char (str)) {
      c = bson_utf8_get_char (str);
      printf ("The numberic value is %u.\n", (unsigned)c);
   }
}
