.SH "DESCRIPTION"

This function shall begin a new bulk operation. After creating this you may call various functions such as
.BR mongoc_bulk_operation_update(3)
,
.BR mongoc_bulk_operation_insert(3)
and others.

After calling
.BR mongoc_bulk_operation_execute(3)
the commands will be executed in as large as batches as reasonable by the client.

If
.B ordered
is true, then processing will stop at the first error.

If
.B ordered
is not true, then the bulk operation will attempt to continue processing even after the first failure.

.B write_concern
should contain the write concern you wish to have applied to all operations within the bulk operation.

.SH "ERRORS"

Errors are propagated when executing the bulk operation.

.SH "RETURNS"

A newly allocated
.BR mongoc_bulk_operation_t
that should be freed with
.BR mongoc_bulk_operation_destroy(3)
when no longer in use.

.B NOTE
.RS
Failure to handle the result of this function is a programming error.
