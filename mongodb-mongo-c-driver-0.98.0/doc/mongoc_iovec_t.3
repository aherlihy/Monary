The
.B mongoc_iovec_t
structure is a portability abstraction for consumers of the
.BR mongoc_stream_t
interfaces. It allows for scatter/gather I/O through the socket subsystem.

.B NOTE
.RS
When writing portable code, beware of the ordering of
.B iov_len
and
.B iov_base
as they are different on various platforms. Therefore, you should not use C initializers for initialization.
