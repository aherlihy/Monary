Version 0.3.0
-------------

    * Upgraded to latest version of Mongo C driver (1.0.0).

    * monary_connect() now takes a MongoDB URI or a hostname and
      port. (See http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/connection-string/
      for more information.)

    * cmonary.c can now freely cast between all integer and floating-type
      values.

    * Turned off debug messages by default.

    * datehelper.py now allows negative timedeltas and times before the epoch

    * Removed the authenticate() method: this is a breaking change. If your code
      relied on authenticate(), you must now include the username and password
      in the MongoDB URI passed into the Monary constructor.

Version 0.2.3
-------------

    * Corrected issue with query sorts.

    * Updated setup.py for packaging on PyPI.

Version 0.1.4
-------------

    * Upgraded to latest version of Mongo C driver.  (Changed signature for mongo_connect() function.)

Version 0.1.3
-------------

    * Added support for sorting queries and providing hints.  (See Monary.query method.)

    * Added simple unit tests for Monary.authenticate.

Version 0.1.2
-------------

    * Added support for a "date" type which populates an array of int64 values
      from a BSON date (date value is milliseconds since Jan 1, 1970).

    * Improved column tests.

    * Fixed a minor bug in datehelper.mongodelta_to_timedelta(), which was not accepting
      a numpy.int64 instance as the date value.  (Now we simply convert the incoming arg to a Python int.)

    * Added strict argument checks to datehelper functions.

Version 0.1.1
-------------

    * Bugfix release for issue with ObjectIDs containing NULL bytes
      (ObjectIDs now use a 12-byte 'void' array type in numeric python.)

    * Support for int8, int16, int64, and float32 column types.

    * Basic tests for all column types (requires nosetests).

Version 0.1
-----------

    * Initial Release
