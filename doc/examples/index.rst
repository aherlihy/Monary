Examples
========

This section gives examples of accomplishing specific tasks with Monary.

Unless otherwise noted, all examples assume that **mongod** is running on the
default host and port. If MongoDB is already `downloaded and installed
<http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Getting+Started>`_ on the system, it can be
started by issuing the following in a shell::

    $ mongod

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    connection
    query
    block-query
    aggregation
    monary-param
    insert
    remove
    update
    timestamp
    string
    binary
    ssl
