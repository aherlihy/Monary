This is a very basic MongoDB c driver. This is an alpha release, please email mathias@10gen.com if you run into issues or have API suggestions.

The goal is to be super strict for ultimate portability, no dependencies, and very embeddable anywhere.

You will need JSON-C (http://oss.metaparadigm.com/json-c/) to compile the unit tests, but it is not required for the main libraries.

Building with scons:
scons # this will produce libbson.a and libmongoc.a
scons --c99 # this will use c99 mode in gcc (recommended)
scons test # this will compile and run the unit tests (optional)
scons test --test-server=123.4.5.67 # use remote server for tests

Building with gcc:
gcc --std=c99 -Isrc src/*.c YOUR_APP.c # No -Ddefines are needed in c99 mode on little endien

Building with MSVC:
TODO

#define options (you must use the same flags to compile all apps and libs):
MONGO_BIG_ENDIAN             This must be defined if on a big endian architecture

one of these (defaults to unsigned char if neither is defined)
MONGO_HAVE_BOOL              Define this if your compiler has a plain 'bool' type
MONGO_HAVE_STDBOOL           Define this if you must include <stdbool.h> to get 'bool'

one of these (required if not using c99):
MONGO_HAVE_STDINT            Define this if you have <stdint.h> for int64_t
MONGO_HAVE_UNISTD            Define this if you have <unistd.h> for int64_t
MONGO_USE__INT64             Define this if '__int64' is your compiler's 64bit type (MSVC)
MONGO_USE_LONG_LONG_INT      Define this if 'long long int' is your compiler's 64bit type


Error Handling:
I'm using an exception system based on cexcept. If you would like to gracefully
handle errors, take a look at src/mongo_except.h. It is currently only used for
network failures, but more errors will be used in the future.

TODO:
building on windows
more documentation
checking for $err in query results
query helper for sort and hint
explain and profiler helpers
GridFS
safe-mode modifications (maybe)
cached ensure_index (maybe)
